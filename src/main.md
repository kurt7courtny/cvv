#### 3. Speech-to-Text Service
**Prompt File:** `src/pipeline/speech-to-text.md`

#### 4. Voice Cloning Service
**Prompt File:** `src/pipeline/voice-cloning-service.md`

#### 5. Video Processing Service
**Prompt File:** `src/pipeline/video-processing.md`

#### 6. Task Management Service
**Prompt File:** `src/pipeline/task-management.md`

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users and authentication
users (id, email, password_hash, created_at, subscription_tier)
user_sessions (id, user_id, token, expires_at)

-- Projects and files
projects (id, user_id, name, status, created_at, updated_at)
video_files (id, project_id, original_name, file_path, size, duration)
audio_files (id, video_file_id, file_path, sample_rate, channels)

-- Processing and results
processing_jobs (id, project_id, job_type, status, progress, created_at)
voice_profiles (id, user_id, name, model_path, characteristics)
transcripts (id, audio_file_id, content, language, confidence_score)
```

### API Endpoints
**Reference File:** `src/pipeline/api-endpoints.md`

Complete API documentation including request/response formats, authentication, error handling, and rate limiting.

### Performance Requirements
- Support for concurrent processing of 100+ videos
- Maximum processing time: 5 minutes per minute of video
- 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Real-time progress updates with <1 second latency

### Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for file uploads
- Secure API key management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging for all operations
- GDPR compliance for user data

---

## Success Metrics
- Processing accuracy: >95% for transcription, >90% for voice cloning
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5 rating
- System performance: <30 second average processing time per minute of video
- Scalability: Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime

This specification serves as the comprehensive guide for developing the video voice cloning application. All implementation details should align with these requirements, and any changes should be documented and approved through the project management process.
